# AnimeHeaven Scraper
Hi, this is a basic scraper for the Anime Heaven website I made.
Currently I don't provide a public endpoint for this api, but you can self-host it for free using vercel. Just fork this repository, open vercel.app, make an account and create a new project. For the new project select your fork of this repository, and that should be it, any issues please open one in the issues tab.

# "Documentation"
I won't go too into detail since it's really straightforward, but this api counts with 6 endpoints.
Popular, search, info, watch, download, and tags.
To read more about them visit the wiki section.
